# Sushi Internal Plugins

These are simple integrated plugins that can be instantiated in a JSON config using the type "internal" and choosing one of the available options for the "uid" field.

The plugins under the namespace `sushi.testing.*` were initially only for internal use, but as of Sushi 1.1, plugins have been added which may be useful also to 3rd parties.

A more complete suite of production-level plugins is included through the [Brickworks library](https://www.orastron.com/brickworks) under the namespace `sushi.brickworks.*`.

All parameters send-receive values normalized to the range 0.0-1.0. Their internal ranges and defaults are listed in parenthesis.

## Audio In / Audio Out Plugins

### Passthrough

Simply a bypass.

  * **uid** : "sushi.testing.passthrough"
  * **Parameters** : none

### Gain

Simple gain plugin. Note that the input controls are not smoothed, so it is not suitable to be used in a real-time context where the gain is adjusted by the user.
For those use cases, prefer using the internal gain parameter of the tracks.

  * **uid** : "sushi.testing.gain"
  * **Parameters** :
    + "gain" : gain in dB. Default: 0.83. (Normalized from [-120, 24], Default 0.0).

### Equalizer

Parametric peak equalizer (single band). The implementation is based on the warped bilinear transform following RBJ Audio Cookbook's formulas.
Parameters are smoothed and can be modulated at run-time.

  * **uid** : "sushi.testing.equalizer"
  * **Parameters** :
    + "frequency" : center frequency in Hertz. Default 0.05. (Normalized from [20, 20'000], Default: 1000.0).
    + "gain" : output gain in dB. Default: 0.0. (Normalized from [-24, 24], Default: 0.0).
    + "q" : Q factor of the filter. Default: 0.1. (Normalized from [0, 10], Default: 1.0).

### Mono Summing

### Send

Sends audio to a return bus plugin. Can be used for creating effect sends, parallel processing, or more complex audio routings. With the default parameters all channels of the track are sent to the return instance but it can also be configured to send a range of channels using the "channel_count" and "start_channel" parameters.

  * **uid** : "sushi.testing.send"
  * **Parameters** :

### Return

Return bus plugin. Receives audio from 1 or several Send plugins. The audio output from a Return plugin is delayed by 1 processing buffer.

  * **Parameters** :

### Reverb (freeverb)

Wrapper around the famous freeverb public-domain implementation. Mono/stereo reverb based on a Schroeder/Moorer model with comb & allpass filters. The internal parameters sound best at 44.1 kHz and are usable also for 48 kHz, but not for higher sampling rates.

The implementation does not have any smoothing of parameter values, so if those are varied continuously some glitches could be heard. A workaround for a common situation consists in putting the reverb 100% wet in an auxiliary track with a send/return plugin combination (check `misc/config_files/freeverb_aux.json` for an example).

## Brickwork plugins

From version 1.1, Sushi includes a suite of high-quality FX plugins written using the [Brickworks library](https://www.orastron.com/brickworks) by Orastron. They are mostly high-quality implementation of staple FXs (Chorus, distortions, etc.), with some lower-level plugins (e.g. multimode filter) that could be useful in some situations.

The implementation is especially good for parameter smoothing and coefficient interpolation, so they should all sound good even when the parameters are modulated at a high control frequency.

You can play around with all the FX plugins using the example configuration file `misc/config_files/play_brickworks_fx.json`, which includes all of them (bypassed by default) in a single track.

Brickworks is dual-licensed GPL3 / commercial; a commercial license of Sushi includes the rights to keep these plugin implementations inside it, but it does not give you the rights to extrapolate Brickworks and use it in another project unless you use the GPL3-licensed version of Brickworks.

Part of the following documentation is taken from the official Brickworks API.
