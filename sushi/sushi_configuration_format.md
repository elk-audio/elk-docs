    * **"uri"** - This is instead of "path", for natively hosting LV2 plugins. The LV2 standard requires that plugins are accessed through the LV2 platform tools, not directly. The paths where these platform tools search for plugins is on Linux defined with the LV2_PATH environment variable.
    * **“uid”** - For internal plugin this has the format “sushi.testing.plugin_name”. For VST 3 plugins, this is the string id of the plugin to load, as multiple plugins can be packaged inside one plugin folder/binary. Not valid for VST 2 plugins.

## Open Sound Control Connections

**"osc"** -  Open Sound Control (OSC) notifications from processors.

Here you can enable OSC messages to be transmitted from Sushi, whenever a processor's internal parameter is changed - for example, the level parameters of the internal Peak Meter plugin.

This works in two ways, either all, or only specific processors, are enabled. The below two all/processor entries are thus mutually exclusive, and cannot coexist in a configuration:

- **"enable_all_processor_outputs"** - Set this to true, for all possible OSC notifications, from all processors, to be transmitter.
- **"enable_processor_outputs"** - Enable the OSC notifications for the specific processors. This is a list of entries with fields:
  - **"processor"** - The name of the track or plugin to connect from.
    - **"parameter_blocklist"** - A list of parameters of the processor, which should not trigger notifications.
      - **"parameter"** - The name of the parameter to block the OSC output from.

## Control voltage and Gate connections

**"cv\_control"** - Control Voltage (CV) and Gate connections to and from tracks and plugins.

* **"cv\_inputs"** - Connect a CV input to parameter changes. Values from the selected CV input will be converted to parameter changes on the selected parameter. A list of routing objects with the following members:
    * **"cv"** - The id of the CV input to connect from.
    * **"processor"** - The name of the track or plugin to connect to.
    * **"parameter"** - The name of the parameter to connect the CV input to.
* **"cv\_outputs"** - Connect parameters to CV outputs Parameter changes from the plugin will appear as values on the selected CV output. A list of routing objects with the following members:
    * **"cv"** - The id of the CV input to send values to.
    * **"processor"** - The name of the track or plugin to connect from.

    * **"processor"** - The name of the plugin or track to connect to.
    * **"gate"** - The id of the Gate input.
    * **"note\_no"** - The note number to use for gate events from this gate input (0-127)
    * **"channel"** - The note number to use for gate events from this gate input (0-15)
* **"gate\_outputs"** - Connect gate inputs to plugins. A list of routing objects with the following members:
    * **"mode"** - The mode to use for the selected gate output, currently "note_event" is the only supported mode. In this mode note events sent from the plugin with the selected note numbers and channel will be converted to gate events (note on to positive gate and note on) and sent to the selected Gate output.
    * **"processor"** - The name of the plugin to connect from.
    * **"gate"** - The id of the Gate output.
    * **"note\_no"** - The note number to use for gate events from this gate output (0-127)

## Events
**“events”** - A list of events to play back during processing. For the offline and dummy frontends, these events will be played back at the time set in the event object. For Raspa and Jack frontends, the time member is ignored and all events are sent immediately when starting Sushi.
While events can be used to set values of plugin parameters and properties when starting sushi, the recommended way to set the startup values is through the **Initial State** section.

* **“type”** - Type of event, valid values are “parameter_change”, “property_change”, “note_on” and “note_off”.
* **“time”** - Time, in seconds from the start of Sushi, when event should be executed.

    * **“property_name”** - If “type” = “property_change”, the name of the string property to set.
    * **“value”** - If “type” = “parameter_change”, the decimal value to set. If “type” = “property_change”, the string value to set.
    * **“note”** - Note value to set, only valid if “type” = “note_on” or “note_off”.

* **"bypassed"** - If included, set the initial bypass state of the processor.
* **"parameters"** - A list of name - value pairs for parameters that will be set on the processor.
* **"properties"** - A list of name - value pairs for string properties that will be set on the processor.
